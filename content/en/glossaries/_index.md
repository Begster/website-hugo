# Sharable glossaries

## About sharable glossaries

Glossaries are easy to set up for simple examples but very hard to scale - especially when you try to scale across use cases, across domains and across different organizations.  
Unfortunately, in 2022, the world is yet to:

1.  Agree on a common glossary format.
1.  See the format widely adopted.

We aim to change this by breaking down technical barriers, raising awareness of solutions, and supporting widespread adoption of _sharable glossaries_.

## Use cases

Initial high value use cases to target include:

+   Auto-generate your glossary by passing your documents against an authoritative source.
+   Enable popup descriptions for your project's acronyms.
+   Personalize spell checking tooling.

Refer to [glossary use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-vRxjMUUsqc5XuxcVdmtKEsm7iOeHZWFArRnNQiLoU/edit#heading=h.frroqlwgaa8o) for more use cases and more details.

## Maturity levels

Investing in a project's sharable glossary infrastructure will unlock glossary based use cases.

## Roadmap to sharable glossaries

Some may think it optimistic to nudge the world toward adopting sharable glossaries. We believe it is achievable, within a few years, by: breaking the problem into solvable components, and collaborating with domain experts for each part of the problem.

These components include:

+   Establish a development community.
+   Establish a _shareable glossary_ standard format.
+   Publish prominent glossaries as a web service using this standard.
+   Scale, by making it super-easy for projects to auto-generate a glossary file for their websites from authoritative glossaries.
+   Incrementally add tooling to realize glossary use cases.
+   Introduce governance best practices.
+   Provide user, and implementation guides.

Refer to our [detailed roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kPK5VgCX01Q5EKdN0zvRM-7ua0KiF-BfDZ9POQJXgrA/) and [current status](#heading=h.12kckmkaup3e) for more details.
