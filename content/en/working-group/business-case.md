In industry, we often find ourselves arguing for greater investment in documentation.

We aim to discover the optimal information that could be used for a documentation business case, then create materials that help people make their own business case supporting documentation investment.

We are identifying key statistics and metrics used by business decision makers, that could be used to support a proposal for increasing docs investment.
