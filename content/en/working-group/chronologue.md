description: Creating a fictional example software project, called Chronologue, for when documentation needs examples. We're on a mission to avoid 'foo' and 'bar', so we're writing real, contextual examples for use by The Good Docs and other projects.

Examples are good. They help templateers demonstrate how a template works and they help readers understand a complex concept.
We want to avoid using 'foo' and 'bar' - the Lorem Ipsum of code placeholders.
We're working to create a fake software product (and the world it exists in) to allow templateers and documentarians to have a wealth of meaningful contextual examples for use in documentation.
Everyone is welcome to come and play with us. If you've always wanted to create a fake API or design a fake UI, this is the group for you. If you've got a flair for fiction writing, world-building or simply want to come and have some fun, please join us.
