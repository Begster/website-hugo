poc: "[Tina Lüdtke](https://thegooddocs.slack.com/team/U02EQQDFLE8)"
meeting: Saturdays 12 pm (Pacific time).
status: Active
description: The Chronologue is a fictional example software project to illustrate what
  good documentation looks like. We're on a mission to avoid 'foo' and 'bar', so
  we're writing real, contextual examples for use by The Good Docs and other
  projects.

Examples are good.
They help templateers demonstrate how a template works and they help readers understand a complex concept.
We want to avoid using 'foo' and 'bar' - the Lorem Ipsum of code placeholders.
We're working to create a fake software product: The Chronologue.

The Chronologue is a fictional telescope that can look into the past, and make predictions for the future, too. 
Users can watch pre-rendered events on a website, or submit requests for new events to be recorded. 

What we've already done so far: 
- Prototyping user journeys and wireframes 
- Specifying an API to retrieve data

What we're currently up to: 
- Building a prototype of a website
- Writing the first set of documentation

Our goal is serve as an example that templateers and documentarians can use to demonstrate what good docs look like.

Everyone is welcome to come and play with us.
