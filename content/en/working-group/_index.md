# The Good Docs Project Working Groups

Working Groups are formed by volunteers who coalesce around goals or a collection of projects that we think will benefit the community.
Please see the details for each working group below to see where you can help.

A working group consists of two or more templateers who are collaborating together to work on a Good Docs Project initiative or focus area of the project.
Working groups can be organized on a temporary, ad-hoc basis or can exist as a long-term, permanent basis as long as there is sufficient interest to maintain them.

All working groups are open for anyone to join as a general rule.
Contributors can belong to as many working groups as they have time for and itâ€™s okay to join a group to observe for a while before contributing.
If you are interested in contributing to a working group, join their Slack channel to ask how you can get involved.
