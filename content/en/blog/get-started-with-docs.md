Do you find yourself in the shoes of someone who has to write documentation for the first time ever? The closer you look, the more you will find that technical writing - the craft of documenting things - is actually quite a broad discipline. Upon the tons of resources, it can be hard to figure out what you need to know to get started. 

In this post, I want to empower you to make informed decisions about your first set of software documentation!  


## üß† Learning the basics

It can be tempting to start writing down your thoughts all in one document. But what makes perfect sense to you isn‚Äôt necessarily easy to digest for your users. In technical writing, scoping information and ordering it in a logical manner is critical so that your audience doesn‚Äôt get lost. I can recommend the following resources - especially if you are new to documentation: 



* ‚úçÔ∏è [Google Tech Writing Course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing): This course was developed by technical writers at Google for software engineers. It covers the very basics of writing understandable documentation. It is a great starting point, especially if you feel like you‚Äôre not a strong writer (yet).
* üìö [Docs for Developers](https://docsfordevelopers.com/): This book explains beautifully what to focus on when you build your documentation for the first time. In contrast to the Google tech writing course, the book focuses less on the stylistic elements of writing and more on the whole documentation process from conception to publication and measuring documentation quality. I definitely recommend reading it before starting your writing process. 


## ‚úçÔ∏èWriting - Let‚Äôs get to it

After working on your foundational understanding of technical writing, you will have a clearer picture about how to organize your content and how to scope it. Next comes the hard part: getting words on to a blank page. Let me introduce you to my favorite resources when it comes to writing: 



* üìÑ [The Good Docs project templates](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates#the-templates): This repository contains all the guts and glory that the Good Docs project is working on: **Templates**! Our aim is to help you write awesome documentation. If you have questions about how to use a template or want to work on a template, join our [Good Docs Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/zt-be2gay0m-Ukq_5SI0MHp20IQP3auQjg). We look forward to seeing you around! 
* üì∫ [Write the Docs YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WritetheDocs/videos): Sometimes we face writing struggles and don‚Äôt know how to solve them. Most likely, someone else had to overcome a similar challenge and has shared their knowledge in the form of a talk. You can find practical topics like selecting a documentation tool, crafting good error messages, and many other well-crafted talks on the Write the Docs YouTube channel.


## üí¨ Networking - It takes a village 

When I am learning something new, my mind is buzzing and I want to bounce around ideas. Luckily, you can find like-minded people from all over the world in wonderful documentation communities. 



* üåê [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/): This group consists of documentarians who mostly work on software. Write the Docs holds networking events like Meetups and conferences, and hosts a Slack channel for in-between communication. The community is very diverse in terms of location, age, and identities. It‚Äôs a warm and welcoming place with a lot of friendly faces to bounce around ideas with.
* üåê [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/): The Society for Technical Communication (STC) is an American professional organization for technical writers from every field and domain you can imagine - from government-related domains, to hardware documentation, to software documentation. The STC holds conferences and chapter meetings, which are free most of the time. STC also fosters relations with the academical side of documentation and provides certification and regular publications; these require a paid membership.

This blog post only provides a few hints on how to get started. 
The technical writing discipline is dynamic and growing, and more knowledge is being shared every day.

Happy writing!
